Images a quite similar to  links but be careful. here is how you do images
Please note that images can also have a URL

They follow this Syntax:

Synatax with an image in my folder (the same folder as the MD file.)
`![Picture of coding](/what-is-coding-1024x683.jpg "Matrix")`
![Picture of coding](/resources/what-is-coding-1024x683.jpg "Matrix")
